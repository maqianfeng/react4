# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- React 只会更新必要的部分 React DOM 首先会比较元素内容先后的不同，而在渲染过程中只会更新改变了的部分。 -->
<!-- 由于 JSX 就是 JavaScript，一些标识符像 class 和 for 不建议作为 XML 属性名。作为替代，React DOM 使用 className 和 htmlFor 来做对应的属性。 -->
<!-- 添加自定义属性需要使用 data- 前缀 -->
<!-- 原生 HTML 元素名以小写字母开头，而自定义的 React 类名以大写字母开头，比如 HelloMessage 不能写成 helloMessage。除此之外还需要注意组件类只能包含一个顶层标签，否则也会报错。 -->
